# 🌍 Chat Language Fix - Pappa Fresh

## ✅ **Issue Identified & Resolved**

**Problem**: The chat bot was replying in Italian regardless of the customer's language, causing communication barriers for English-speaking customers.

**Root Cause**: The AI prompt didn't have strict language rules, and the language detection algorithm was basic.

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### 1. **Enhanced AI Prompt System** ✅
- **Before**: Basic prompt with simple language instruction
- **After**: Comprehensive prompt with CRITICAL LANGUAGE RULES

**New Language Rules**:
1. Always respond in EXACTLY the same language as the customer's message
2. If customer writes in Italian → reply ONLY in Italian
3. If customer writes in English → reply ONLY in English
4. For any other language → reply in that language
5. NEVER mix languages in one response

### 2. **Improved Language Detection Algorithm** ✅
- **Before**: Basic heuristic with limited Italian/English indicators
- **After**: Enhanced algorithm with comprehensive language triggers

**Enhanced Italian Indicators**:
- Articles: `il`, `lo`, `la`, `gli`, `le`, `dei`, `delle`, `degli`
- Common words: `ciao`, `come`, `cosa`, `grazie`, `per`, `posso`
- Question words: `quanto`, `quando`, `dove`, `chi`, `quale`
- Verbs: `sono`, `hai`, `abbiamo`, `voglio`, `vorrei`
- Business terms: `ordin`, `spedizion`, `abbonam`, `prezzo`

**Enhanced English Indicators**:
- Articles: `the`, `a`, `an`
- Common words: `and`, `or`, `how`, `what`, `thanks`, `please`
- Question words: `when`, `where`, `who`, `which`
- Verbs: `are`, `have`, `want`, `would`, `could`, `can`
- Business terms: `order`, `shipping`, `subscription`, `price`

### 3. **Updated Product Knowledge Base** ✅
- All packets: 400g at €6.66 each
- Complete recipe details with ingredients and calories
- Delivery information: 24-48 hours (sometimes 24-72h)
- Storage instructions: fridge 3-4 days, freeze up to 3 months
- Subscription details: 10% discount

### 4. **Example Conversations in Both Languages** ✅
- **English examples**: Product info, storage, off-topic refusal
- **Italian examples**: Subscription, delivery, vet information
- **Consistent tone**: Concise, friendly, professional
